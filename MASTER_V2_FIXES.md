# Master V2 Module Fixes

## Problems Fixed

1. **Data Format Inconsistency**
   - Historical data and live data had different formats 
   - Column order was inconsistent
   - Timestamps weren't consistently sorted in ascending order

2. **SQL Query Errors**
   - Queries used conflicting column names in subqueries
   - Column naming strategy between functions was inconsistent
   - Some ClickHouse-specific syntax was incompatible with the current version

3. **Live Data Integration**
   - `insert_latest_data` wasn't properly updating the master table
   - Data wasn't being normalized consistently with historical data

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Consistent Data Processing**
   - Used the same SQL structure for both `reinit_current_day` and `insert_latest_data`
   - Added consistent `ORDER BY timestamp ASC, ticker ASC` in all queries
   - Matched column order with historical data

2. **Robust SQL Queries**
   - Used unique column aliases for timestamps in each subquery
   - Fixed column naming to avoid conflicts (`quote_timestamp` â†’ `timestamp`, etc.)
   - Added error handling with fallbacks when complex queries fail

3. **Consistent Normalization**
   - Used the same normalization logic as in master.py
   - Applied the sigmoid normalization formula consistently
   - Ensured target calculation follows the same logic

4. **Improved Data Quality**
   - Added proper `NULL` handling with `coalesce` and `nullIf`
   - Added consistent rounding for numeric values
   - Fixed array handling for conditions

5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added try/except blocks to catch specific SQL errors
   - Implemented fallback approach when primary approach fails
   - Added system marker records to indicate processing occurred

## Testing & Verification

We created several testing tools to verify our fixes:

1. **test_master_v2.py** - Tests specific functions in the master_v2 module
2. **test_live_integration.py** - Tests the complete live data cycle
3. **check_master_data.py** - Checks data in the master table
4. **check_historical_data.py** - Compares historical and current data

All tests now pass successfully, and the data formatting is consistent between historical and live data.

## Usage

The master_v2 module now works correctly with the live_data.py script, ensuring that the master table is properly updated after each data collection cycle. The workflow is:

1. Collect latest data through live_data.py
2. Insert data into source tables (bars, quotes, trades, indicators)
3. Call master_v2.insert_latest_data() to update the master and normalized tables
4. Process model predictions

## Code Changes Summary

- Updated `insert_latest_data` to use the same approach as master.py
- Rewritten `reinit_current_day` to match `insert_latest_data` logic
- Fixed column aliasing to avoid query conflicts
- Added consistent ordering in all SQL queries
- Used the same normalization formula throughout
- Added error handling and fallback mechanisms
